#freezing.css - A CSS micro-framework

## How to use?

Just add this line to your `HTML` files, in `<head>` tag:

```html

<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.rawgit.com/prp-e/freezing.css/master/freezing.css" />

```

Then, use classes in `freezing.css`, like this :

```html
<div class = "freezing-light-blue">
...
</div>
```

## Etymology 

The word "freezing" comes from one of my favorite songs by __Mayhem__, a norwegian band, called _Freezing Moon_.
